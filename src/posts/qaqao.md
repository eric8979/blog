#### Project Description

<br>

**This post is a build log(b-log) of qaqao(mock kakao)**

<br>

"qaqao" is chatting website inspired by kakao the chatting application. The website will function almost identical as the kakao app. But the UI will be horrible since the goal of this project is to learn back-end programming.

<br>

- Project Goal: Learn how to add graphql on node/express.
- What I can achieve: How to build full-stack(MERN) website more sustainable.
- Language: GraphQL, TypeScript, Scss
- Tech: MERN, Apollo, yarn, git

<br>

#### Day-1 - Setup

(qaqao GitHub repo link)[https://github.com/eric8979/qaqao.git]

<br>

While setting up the back-end, I noticed that Apollo has quite a concept. So I decided to learn the basics first.
