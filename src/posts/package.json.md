#### What is a MERN stack?

MERN is abbreviation of 4 frameworks/enviorment for web-development.

<br>

- **M**ongoDB - database
- **E**xpress - nodejs framework
- **R**eact - front-end framework
- **N**odejs - javascript runtime enviorment

<br>

#### Before you jump in...

Prerequisites: basic understanding on...

<br>

- TypeScript/JavaScript, Scss/CSS, GraphQL/Apollo
- package installer: npm/yarn
- React
- node/express
- mongoDB(NoSQL database)

<br>

I'm sure that you already have installed node and npm(yarn), but for those of you who haven't, follow these steps. Plus this guide is optimized for macOS users.

<br>

1. [install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) - You'll get npm alongside.
2. [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) - This project uses yarn.
3. [install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) - For "Live Sass Compiler" you need this.

#### MERN boilerplate

I created a boilerplate repo on GitHub. Clone it on your computer.

<br>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/eric8979/mern-boilerplate.git
```

<br>

Next, read the README. Basic info is in there.
